# React-Native-Course
Code from the Stephen Grider React Native course on 
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course)

## Progress

  Beginning Section 5 - Reusable components

## Differences from Stephen

Nothing substantial yet :-)

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years. Over that time, I have tried
many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was easier
and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
