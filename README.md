# React-Native-Course
Code from the Stephen Grider React Native course on 
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course)

## PROBLEMS

If you have any unexpected problems, where you have exactly the same 
code as Stephen but you have big red messages instead of an app.

**TRY STOPPING THE SERVER AND RUNNING `npm start` AGAIN.**

This is particularly true if you have messages like `Cannot load module "94"`
which is truly mystifying :-)

## Progress

  Lecture 101 - beginning to show search results

## Differences from Stephen

* My rn-starter directory is more or less untouched from Stephen's zip file.
  I have started my first app in a directory called `first`.

* I have styled everything much more in the first app.

* I have added prop types to all the screens and components, because ESLint whines 
  about them being missing :-)

* I rarely, if ever, use the name `payload` for the data contained in a Redux /
  reducer action. The main exception to this is when using `redux-promise` which 
  requires that the promised data name has to be `payload`.

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years. Over that time, I have tried
many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was easier
and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
